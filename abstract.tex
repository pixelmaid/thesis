The accessibility, diversity, and functionality of modern computer systems make computer programming useful in many realms of human study and advancement. Visual and physical art, craft, and design are interrelated domains that offer exciting possibilities when combined with programming. Unfortunately, the use of programming is currently limited as a medium for art and design for young people and amateur programmers. Many potential users view programming as highly specialized, difficult, inaccessible, and only relevant as a career path in science, engineering, or business fields, rather than as a mode of personal expression. Despite this perception, programming has the potential to correspond well with physical craft practices. By forging a strong connections between programming and the construction of personally relevant physical objects, it may be possible to foster meaningful creative experiences for non-professionals. The term algorithmic craft describes the combination of computational design, digital fabrication and craft to create functional artifacts. This thesis describes my work in developing a set of software tools that attempt to make the practice of algorithmic craft accessible for novice programers. Through it, I describe the design of each tool and discuss my experiences in engaging people in the creation of objects that are designed with programming, formed by machines, and shaped by hand.
