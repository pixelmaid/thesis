\chapter{Introduction}

Computation is a driving force in our world. The power and ubiquity of  modern computer systems have made the skill of computer programming (hereafter programming) relevant to a wide range of human studies and disciplines. Most commonly, programming is viewed as an essential component of science, engineering, and business related applications\cite{resnick1}. As a result, many nascent programmers view programming as highly specialized, difficult, inaccessible, and only relevant as a career path in those particular fields. In reality, computation is a broad discipline with many applications, ranging from professional to personal. Foremost programing can serve as a medium for personal expression, through applications in art and design. With the emergence of digital fabrication technology, In addition, programing provides the means to design and produce useful objects and devices, not only on at an industrial scale, but also on a personal and individual scale \cite{mellis_thesis}. When programing is used create unique, functional physical objects, new possibilities emerge in the way people design,  the types of objects people create, and role programing can play in peoples' lives.  Computational design, the practice of programming to create form, structure and ornamentation, is a new way to design. When paired with digital fabrication technology, computational design allows people to make physical objects by writing code. My objective is to examine the combination of computational design, digital fabrication and traditional arts and crafts for the production of functional decorative objects. I define this domain with the term algorithmic craft. In this thesis, I will define the affordances of algorithmic craft and describe the development and dissemination of three tools to support novice practitioners in this domain. The process of bridging the spaces between textual programming language, visual design, and physical construction however, is not self-evident and raises many practical and theoretical questions.  What are the important design principles to consider when creating  programming environments for physical design? How do we compellingly link textual code with visual designs and what are the appropriate intersection points between textual manipulation and visual manipulation? What support is required to help people move back and forth from programming to building real objects in a way that is comfortable, expressive and pleasurable? How can we remove the technical challenges in translating code into an object that can be successfully fabricated, while still supporting a wide variety of design styles, aesthetics and approaches? Finally, how can we interlink the often disparate processes of physical prototyping with digital design and programming in a way that creatively reinforces both physical and virtual modes of working?
