\textit{``The type of work which modern technology is most successful in reducing or even eliminating is skillful, productive work of human hands, in touch with real materials of one kind or another. In an advanced industrial society, such work has become exceedingly rare. A great part of the modern neurosis may be due to this very fact; for the human being enjoys nothing more to be creatively, usefully, productively engaged with both his hands and his brains."}
